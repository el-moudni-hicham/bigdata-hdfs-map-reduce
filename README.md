#### What is MapReduce?
MapReduce is a programming model or pattern within the Hadoop framework that
is used to access big data stored in the Hadoop File System (HDFS).

#### How MapReduce Works?
At the crux of MapReduce are two functions: Map and Reduce. They are sequenced one after the other.

* The `Map` function takes input from the disk as <key,value> pairs, processes them, and produces another set of intermediate <key,value> pairs as output.

* The `Reduce` function also takes inputs as <key,value> pairs, and produces <key,value> pairs as output.
